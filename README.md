Activity 10: Cross-Platform To-Do List App

Project Overview
- This project is a To-Do List Application designed to demonstrate the core concepts of mobile development as outlined in Activity 10.
  While built using Native Android (Kotlin), it focuses on creating a single-screen UI that handles shared logic for task management—a key principle in cross-platform development.
  The app provides a clean, modern interface using Material Design components to ensure a professional user experience.

Features

- Modern Material UI: Features a light blue toolbar and a Floating Action Button (FAB) for a clean and intuitive look.

- Dynamic Task Input: Users can easily add new tasks through a stylized popup dialog.

- Task List Display: All active tasks are displayed in a scrollable list format for easy tracking.

- Interactive Deletion: Includes the ability to remove tasks by tapping on them, complete with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion.

- Single-Screen Efficiency: The entire application logic is contained within a single screen to keep the scope manageable and performance high.

How to Use

1. Launch the App: Open the application on your Android device or emulator.

2. Add a Task: Click the Floating Action Button (+) at the bottom right of the screen.

- A dialog will appear asking you to "Add New Task."

- Type your task (e.g., "Clean the room") and click Add.

3. View Tasks: Your new task will immediately appear in the list on the main screen.

4. Remove a Task: Simply tap on any task in the list.

- A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you want to delete the task.

- Click Delete to remove it from your list.
